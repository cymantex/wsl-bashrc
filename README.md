# .bashrc
The point of this repository is to help setting up my WSL1 Ubuntu `.bashrc` with some utilities I've generally found useful.

# Getting started
1. Copy the content of the `default-bashrc` to the top of your `~/.bashrc`.
2. Edit the variables you copied from `default-bashrc` to match your system preferences.
3. You can now access any utilities in `bashrc/lib`.
