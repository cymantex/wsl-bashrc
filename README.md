# .bashrc
The point of this repository is to help setting up my WSL2 Ubuntu terminal and `.bashrc` with some utilities I've generally found useful.

# New WSL install instructions:
1. `touch ~/.sudo_as_admin_successful` to remove an annoying startup message
2. Create SSH keys
3. Clone this repo
4. Copy the content of the `default-bashrc` to the top of your `~/.bashrc`.
5. Edit the variables you copied from `default-bashrc` to match your system preferences.
6. Run `installOrUpdateAllCliTools` and follow the instructions of any prompts
